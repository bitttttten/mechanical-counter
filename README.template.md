### Help

The component will only animate numbers and common number separators: `,`, `.`, and `-`. If you want to include text before the number, then you must include that along side the component. It's totally fine to include non-supported characters in the text you send in to the component through the "text" prop, however, they must be added as a suffix to the text.

Here is an example of adding text before the number, as a prefix, and also including some plain textâ€”that is "unsupported characters"â€”after the number, as a suffix.

```js
<div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center" }}>
  EUâ‚¬
  <MechanicalCounter text="5,407 total cost" />
</div>
```

The code above will result in the following:
